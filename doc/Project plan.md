Introduction

## Descriptions

Takeaway would like us to bring these drivers closer to the customers by means of a text chat based application that we are going to build.

Couriers would like to message the customer directly to receive additional directions in order to deliver the order. In addition to the courier app, customers would need a means to chat with the courier as well. A simple chat interface for clients would do, keeping the focus on the courier app.
