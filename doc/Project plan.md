Introduction

## Descriptions

Takeaway would like us to bring these drivers closer to the customers by means of a text chat based application that we are going to build.

Couriers would like to message the customer directly to receive additional directions in order to deliver the order. In addition to the courier app, customers would need a means to chat with the courier as well. A simple chat interface for clients would do, keeping the focus on the courier app.

### Persistence Description
Project persistance is meant to teach us how to store data in a real world scenario. The app we are creating is dependant on some form of database 
in order to store and load information about users and orders. That is the main goal of project persistance, to learn how to make an app from front
end to back end for the android platform.

### General project description 
The goal of this project is to develop an app for Takeaway.com to their set specifications. The app that will be developed is a courier-client messaging app, with the main functionality of the app being a messaging system that communicates the clients of Takeaway.com to their couriers. The app will be developed and tested for the android platform. Using a backend and front end written in the Java programming language. The database that was chosen for this application is the PostgreSQL database. The user interface design will be created using mostly Adobe Xd, and will be designed following the specifications in the Takeaway.com visual identity as closely as possible.
